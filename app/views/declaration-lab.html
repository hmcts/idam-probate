<div class="text">
    <p>We, {{ applicantName }} of {{ data.applicant.home | address }} and [Your-Co-Applicant] of 12 Any Street, London, N7 2DH, make the following statement:</p>

<p class="heading-small">The person who died</p>

<p>{{ data['deceasedFirstName'] }} {{ data['deceasedLastName'] }} was born on {{data['dob_day']}} {{ data['dob_month'] | month ]}} {{data['dob_year']}} and died on {{data['dod_day']}} {{ data['dod_month']| month }} {{data['dod_year']}}, domiciled in England and Wales.</p>

<p class="heading-small">The estate</p>

<p>The gross estate value for the estate amounts to {{ data | getGrossIHT | currency }} and the net estate value amounts to {{ data | getNetIHT | currency }}.</p>

<p>To the best of our knowledge, information and belief, there was no land vested in {{ data['deceasedFirstName'] }} {{ data['deceasedLastName'] }} which was settled previously to the death (and not by the will) of {{ data['deceasedFirstName'] }} {{ data['deceasedLastName'] }} and which remained settled land notwithstanding such death.</p>

<p class="heading-small">Executors applying for probate</p>

<p>{{ applicantName }}, an executor named in the will, is applying for probate.<p>

<p>{{ applicantName }} will sign and send to the probate registry what they believe to be the true and original last will and testament of {{ data['deceasedFirstName'] }} {{ data['deceasedLastName'] }}.</p>

<p>[Your-Co-Applicant], an executor named in the will, is applying for probate.</p>

<p>[Your-Co-Applicant] will sign a photocopy of what they believe to be the true and original last will and testament of {{ data['deceasedFirstName'] }} {{ data['deceasedLastName'] }}. {{ applicantName }} will send the signed photocopy to the probate registry.</p>

<p class="heading-small">Executors not applying for probate</p>

<p>Jane Smith, an executor named in the will, is not making this application but reserves power to do so at a later date. They have been notified in writing.</p>

<p>Mary Smith, an executor named in the will, is not making this application because they died before {{ data['deceasedFirstName'] }} {{ data['deceasedLastName'] }} died.</p>

<p class="form-title heading-large">Declaration</p>

<p>We confirm that we will administer the estate of {{ data['deceasedFirstName'] }} {{ data['deceasedLastName'] }}, according to law. We will:</p>

<ul class="list list-bullet">
    <li>collect the whole estate</li>
    <li>keep full details (an inventory) of the estate</li>
    <li>keep a full account of how the estate has been administered</li>
</ul>

<p>If the probate registry (court) asks us to do so, we will:</p>

<ul>
    <li>provide full details of the estate and how it has been administered</li>
    <li>return the grant of probate to the court</li>
</ul>

<p>We understand that:</p>

<ul class="list list-bullet">
    <li>our application will be rejected if we do not answer any questions about the information we have given</li>
