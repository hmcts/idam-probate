        Notify the other executors who are applying for probate
    </h1>

    <p>The other executors who are applying for probate now need to make their legal declarations.</p><p>Once you've used this service to notify them, they'll each be sent an email telling them how to make their declarations.</p>

    <div class="panel panel-border-wide">
     <p class="text">
        A grant of probate can't be issued until all the applying executors legally declare that the information is correct.
    </p>
</div>

<h2 class="heading-medium">Staying in contact</h2>

     <p>You'll need to stay in contact with the other applying executors throughout this stage of the application.</p><p>By staying in contact you'll:</p>

     <ul class="list list-bullet">
      <li>know when everyone's made their declarations, so you can return to this service and submit your application</li>
        <li>be able to discuss the information you've provided and make any changes if needed</li></ul>











 <h2 class="heading-medium">
        If you change the information on your application
    </h2>

    <p>You can continue to make changes to your application until everyone has made their legal declaration.</p>

 <p>If you make any changes, you'll need to contact the other applying executors to let them know the legal declaration has been updated and is ready for them to agree.</p>

    <p>They can always see the most up to date version of the legal statement using the link we email them. </p>
