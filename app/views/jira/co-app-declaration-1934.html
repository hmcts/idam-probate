            <p>[Applicant2Name] is applying for probate. They will sign a photocopy of what they believe to be the true and original last will and testament of [DeceasedName]. [Applicant1Name] will send the signed photocopy to the probate registry.</p>

            <p>We are executors named in the will [and number of codicils].
                To the best of our knowledge, information and belief, there was no
                land vested in the person who died which was settled previously to the death (and not by the will)
                of the person who died and which remained settled land notwithstanding such death.</p>

                    <p>[NonApplyingExecName2], another executor named in the will, is not making this application but reserves power to do so at a later date. They have been notified in writing.</p>

                    <p>[NonApplyingExecName3], another executor named in the will, is not making this application because they died before [DeceasedName].</p>
